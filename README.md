# OriGn

This POS shows a demonstration of wireless authentication between one computer (Auth site)
and one phone (User site) with SOUND instead of an internet connection.
The Auth site provides a username and password that the user can log in with to the Auth site.
The user can manually copy the login credentials 
or use OriGn and use sound to transfer the credentials.
